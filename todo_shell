to be super safe with rotation / translation things implement a shell with 
the following commands
l -> lights
s -> shapes
c -> camera
sc -> select camera
sn -> select next shape
sp -> select prev shape
hl -> toggle highlight
w -> width (diam for sp etc)
h -> height (cone and cy)
mv vec -> translation
rot axis angle -> rotation
del -> del
render -> render
new -> read rest of the line like rt file
