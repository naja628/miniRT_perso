test etc:
* norminette main funs
* retest with bump_mapping and spheres
* test Makefile

distance thingy:
* in the bonus : maybe do use distance but use distance at 100% light instead of intensity
* specular highlights and flares should probs depend on the intensity

******* OLD ********* (probs no longer relevant but kept "to be safe")

* gamma correction (DONE, does it really make it better??)

extra bonus:
* memoize stuff
* carve out surface via images ( probs won't do)
* occlusion shadows? (hard : won't do)
