## SHELL COMMANDS

After launching miniRT will try to read commands from stdin that allow the scene to be changed.
There must be one command per line.
Trailings chars after all arguments have been read will be ignored.

Commands are :
s -> select previously selected shape (or last declared in .rt at start)
	 Do nothing if selection is already a shape.
c -> select camera
l -> select previously selected light (or last declared in .rt at start)
	 Do nothing if selection is already a light.
n -> select next element of the same type as selection
ppos -> print position of the selected element
w <new_width> -> set width attribute of element
	<new_width> must be a float
	some elements do not have a 'width' attribute
	width of sp is diameter
	width of cy is diameter
	width of cn is diameter of the circle slice that is 1 unit away from vertex
h <new_height> -> set height attribute of element
	<new_height> is a float
	only cones and cylinders have a height
mv <translation_vec> -> translate element
	<translation_vec> must be written as x,y,z where x, y and z are floats
	(no space allowed next to the commas)
rot <axis> <angle> -> turn element around <axis> by an angle <angle>
	<axis> must be x y or z
	<angle> is in radians
	the center of the rotation is the position of the element
	(center for a sphere, vertex for a cone etc)
render -> apply changes and render the image (not automatic)
