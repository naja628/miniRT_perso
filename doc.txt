## SHELL

After launching miniRT will try to read commands from stdin that allow the scene
to be changed.
There must be one command per line.
Trailings chars after all arguments have been read will be ignored.
To read and execute the next line from stdin you must click on the dispaly
window. (One line per click)
When the shell is waiting for a line the window will be unresponsive.

Commands are :
s -> select previously selected shape (or last declared in .rt at start)
	 Do nothing if selection is already a shape.
c -> select camera
l -> select previously selected light (or last declared in .rt at start)
	 Do nothing if selection is already a light.
n -> select next element of the same type as selection
ppos -> print position of the selected element
w <new_width> -> set width attribute of element
	<new_width> must be a float
	some elements do not have a 'width' attribute
	width of sp is diameter
	width of cy is diameter
	width of cn is diameter of the circle slice that is 1 unit away from vertex
h <new_height> -> set height attribute of element
	<new_height> is a float
	only cones and cylinders have a height
mv <translation_vec> -> translate element
	<translation_vec> must be written as x,y,z where x, y and z are floats
	(no space allowed next to the commas)
rot <axis> <angle> -> turn element around <axis> by an angle <angle>
	<axis> must be x y or z
	<angle> is in radians
	the center of the rotation is the position of the element
	(center for a sphere, vertex for a cone etc)
render -> apply changes and render the image (not automatic)

## BONUS .RT FORMAT

optional arguments in brackets ([])

light decalartions :
L <pos> <intensity> <color> [no_flare]
	<intensity> can be any positive float.
		It represents the distance at which objects hit straight-on by the light
		have 100% of their color.
	<no_flare> : 0 or 1, if 1 don't display flares for this light
	You can have several lights.

shape declarations :
<id> <shape_specific_args> <color> [<diff_coef> <spec_coef> <refl_coef> \
<checker> <bump_map> <bump_map_height>]
	You can use the coefs to give a different feel to the material of the shape.
	All coef between 0 and 1 (sum must be < 1).
	<diff_coef> : proportion of the light reflected diffusely
		You can think of diff_coef being 0.5 as meaning the same thing as having
		the color be half as dark.
	<spec_coef> : proportion of the light reflected specularly (white spots)
	<refl_coef> : proportion of the light reflected in a mirror-like way
	<checker> : 0 or 1, if 1 the shape's surface is checkered.
	<bump_map> : greyscale .xpm file representing heights to "paste" on a shape
	<map_height> : can be any positive float
		If map height is 19 the image will be "pasted" in such a way that there 
		is 19 units of distance between the bottom and top pixels.

All other declarations as in the subject
